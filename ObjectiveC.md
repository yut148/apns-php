# Introduction #

To send Push Notifications to a device, you need a _device token_. Device token is generated by Apple from Device ID and Application ID, so this is unique per device and per application.

# Deprecated #

Please, see the Objective-C Demo Project at http://code.google.com/p/apns-php/source/browse/trunk/Objective-C%20Demo
